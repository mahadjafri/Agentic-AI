      "**Pain Point:** **Dynamic Demand Forecasting & Inventory Optimization in Volatile Markets.**\n",
      "\n",
      "Traditional forecasting struggles with rapid, unpredictable shifts in consumer behavior, geopolitical events, or unexpected disruptions. This leads to either stockouts (lost sales, unhappy customers) or excess inventory (carrying costs, obsolescence). Manually adjusting inventory levels across a complex, multi-echelon supply chain in real-time is impossible, creating a persistent challenge to maintain optimal stock while minimizing costs and ensuring product availability.\n"
